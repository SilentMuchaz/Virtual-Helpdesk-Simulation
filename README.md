# Virtual Helpdesk Simulation for Small Business

This project simulates a virtual helpdesk environment for a small business, designed to provide practical experience with ticket management systems and demonstrate my capabilities to potential employers.  It leverages Freshdesk (trial version) to create a realistic helpdesk experience.  The project includes mock tickets, a knowledge base, and comprehensive documentation.

## Key Features

* **Realistic IT Support Scenarios:**  20 detailed mock tickets covering a range of common IT issues small businesses face, complete with suggested solutions.  These scenarios include [password resets, software installation problems, network connectivity issues].
* **Comprehensive Knowledge Base:**  A structured knowledge base providing step-by-step troubleshooting guides and solutions to common IT problems. This resource is designed for quick reference and efficient problem-solving.
* **Freshdesk Integration:**  The simulation is built using Freshdesk (trial version), a popular helpdesk software. This provides hands-on experience with a real-world platform.
* **Detailed Documentation:**  Includes this 'README' file with instructions on how to explore the project, as well as a separate document [e.g., 'PROJECT_LEARNINGS.pdf'] detailing the project's development, learnings, challenges, and future improvements.

## Technologies Used

* **Freshdesk (Trial Version):**  The core platform for the helpdesk simulation.

## Project Learnings

This project allowed me to gain practical experience with:

* Configuring and using Freshdesk features (e.g., ticket forms, canned responses, knowledge base).
* Understanding Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
* Researching and understanding API integration possibilities (although not fully implemented due to trial limitations).
* Simulating an Agile-like approach to project management.
* Defining simulated requirements based on common small business helpdesk needs.
* Applying customer service best practices within a helpdesk environment.


## How to Explore the Project

1. **Access Mock Tickets:** Navigate to the `Mock_Tickets` folder to view the sample tickets.  Each ticket includes a detailed description of the issue and a proposed solution.
2. **Explore the Knowledge Base:** The `Knowledge_Base` folder contains documentation on common IT issues and their solutions.
